## What is microGravity?

microGravity is a small, offline, self-contained simple Markdown Editor based on **Electron/Node.js**. Currently this project is ***under development*** and has no working app.

## Why microGravity?

microGravity was born as a small self-challenge. I was unsatisfied with Markdown-compatible, simple, focused text editors in offer, usually because of their price. As such I endeavoured to create an alternative I could be proud of, use on my day to day life, and share for others to use. 

This project is free and open, licensed under GPL v3.0+, and will be available at this repository once finished.

## Features and development.

Because this project aims to be usable as a day-to-day system, it presents all main markdown features offered in other comparable editors such as [Typora](https://typora.io) and [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), as well as LaTeX compatibility via [KaTeX](https://katex.org) and flowchart capabilities via [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org).

As of 27/10/2025, the state of development is as follows.

| Feature Class | Feature Type          | Development Tier            |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| A             | Basic Functioning     | 4 (Completed)               |
| B             | Integrated Markdown Engine       | 4 (Completed)       |
| C             | Additional Features   | 1 (Initial Implementation)  |
| D             | Client Core Functions | 1 (Initial Implementation)             |
| PT            | Pretty Things (UI/UX) | 0 (In Planning) |
| N             | Niceties (QoL)        | 2.3 (Active Development)      |

As development continues ***microGravity version 0.1.0***, Working Title *"Please Break Me"*, will be publicly released. This may be preceeded by ***microGravity version 0.0.1alpha*** "minimum viable product".

## Fun bit :)
