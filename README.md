## What is microGravity?

microGravity is a small, offline, self-contained simple Markdown Editor based on **Electron/Node.js**. Currently this project is ***under development***. 

### Make sure to try microGravity v0.0.1α! Now released!

## Why microGravity?

microGravity was born as a small self-challenge. I was unsatisfied with Markdown-compatible, simple, focused text editors in offer, usually because of their price. As such I endeavoured to create an alternative I could be proud of, use on my day to day life, and share for others to use. 

This project is free and open, licensed under GPL v3.0+, and will be available at this repository once finished.

## Features and development.

Because this project aims to be usable as a day-to-day system, it presents all main markdown features offered in other comparable editors such as [Typora](https://typora.io) and [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), as well as LaTeX compatibility via [KaTeX](https://katex.org) and flowchart capabilities via [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org).

As of 4/11/2025, the state of development is as follows.

| Feature Class | Feature Type          | Development Tier            |

## Fun bit :)

This README was entirely written in the microGravity prototype I am working with.
